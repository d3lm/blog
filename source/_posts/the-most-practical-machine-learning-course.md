At MachineLabs our main goal is to make Machine Learning more approachable to the regular developer and help fostering the entire Machine Learning ecosystem.

There are at least two parts on this mission: Creating an environment that makes it easy to run Machine Learning experiments as well as making it simple to learn how to do Machine Learning at all.

Today we are excited to launch the most practical Machine Learning online course.

### Machine Learning Jump Start

Over the last couple of months we've worked tirelessly to make MachineLabs the best platform to get started with Machine Learning.

We are excited to see hundreds of users creating exciting experiments on our platform every day.

That said, there's huge group of developers telling us that they'd love to get started with Machine Learning if it just wasn't that hard.

A lot of people seem to be frustrated with the academic, Math-centered approach to Machine Learning that most courses still take today.

Enter our **Machine Learning Jump Start** online course. This course is unlike any other Machine Learning course that we've found. It's from regular developers for regular developers.
