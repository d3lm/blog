If you work anywhere close to the tech industry you surely heard about Machine Learning. These days many of the most impressive advances in technology rely on trained [neural nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). The idea is simple: Where traditional programming is all about writing code to solve problems, Machine Learning is about feeding enough data to a neural net to have the machine figure out the complicated stuff on its own.

Companies such as Google, Tesla or Cruise are using Machine Learning to build self-driving cars. Applications such as [PRISMA](https://prisma-ai.com/) use it to turn regular photos into amazing art inspired by real artists. Many people believe that Machine Learning and artificial intelligence will have a similar impact on our daily life as the invention of the internet.

But there's a problem though...

## Sience is hard

Despite still being a very academical field, [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) and building our own neural networks isn't a very easy task. That's why frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/) or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) exist - to help making these things easier.

However, even with these great frameworks available it's still unnecessarily hard for traditional, web developers (like us) to dive into this amazing field of software technology. Using Machine Learning to solve problems requires a certain infrastructure and computational power to get things going. Coming from a field like as web development, the barrier of entry can seem very high.

To mention some of the bigger pain points:

- **Setting up the environment is tedious** - Users need to install things like Python, Tensorflow, Keras or Theano, additional librabries and of course, all of this in versions that work in combination.
- **Consumer hardware lacks power** - In order to perform serious deep learning, a lot of hardware power and resources are needed. That's why companies like NVIDIA offer things like [high performance data center GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla/).
- **Training is time consuming** - Often, training a neural net can take several hours or even days. We sure don't want to use our own local machines for that.
- **Exploration and Sharing** - While there are plenty resources, articles and tutorials on deep learning, there doesn't seem to be a way to easily consume, share, demo or even fork experiments with the community.

## Meet MachineLabs

We think Machine Learning should be simple and fun. We believe that, if we manage to help people getting started easier and faster with Machine Learning, everyone will benefit.

With MachineLabs we are building a platform that tries to solve all the problems mentioned and could probably be best described as the [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) for Machine Learning.

## Run your experiments in the cloud

MachineLabs enables you to write and execute your experiments right from within the browser! No installation hassle, no maintenance.

Neural net training may run for hours or even several days and you'll be able to conveniently come back any time to check its status or watch it learning right in the browser as well!

We make sure your experiments run on blazingly fast hardware to crack real world problems!

## Sharing is caring

We believe that for the benefit of everyone it is crucial to accelerate knowledge sharing in the Machine Learning field. With MachineLabs, labs (that's what we call our experiments) can be forked, shared! Imagine having a lab with a steering prediction for a self-driving car right in your browser and have it forkable and hackable for everyone.

Just like people share code snippets and runnable examples for other languages and platforms on website like Stack Overflow or GitHub, we want everyone to be able to share or embed labs on other websites to improve the overall accessibility of this exciting technology.

## Will this be a free service?

We do want to improve the situation for a broad audience. Hence, **labs and existing executions can always be viewed by everyone** (unless intentionally made private). Registered users will also be able to execute code on limited hardware up to the point where a certain monthly limit is reached. To execute code beyond these limitations and on blazingly fast GPU-powered hardware we'll have paid plans.

## Will this be open source?

Yes! Well, while we haven't figured out all details yet we are definitely commited to release big parts of the system as open source once we have settled on a solid first design. And with open souce we really mean it. We'll have the code hosted on GitHub, track and discuss issues in the open and will except pull request from external contributors.

## Request your private beta invite

MachineLabs is in private beta right now so we can finish implementing the most important features with the feedback of selected people that are into Machine Learning before we roll it out for the public. Head over to [our registration page](http://get.machinelabs.ai), tell us about your background and why you want to use MachineLabs and request your personal privat beta invite!

Seats are limited!

## What else to come

We will use this blog to keep you recently posted about latest updates and features landed in MachineLabs' code base so you have a chance to get a better what's happening behind the scenes as the private beta is ongoing.

In the meantime, make sure to follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/machinelabs_ai) and don't miss any updates!
