If you work anywhere close to the tech industry you surely heard about Machine Learning. These days many of the most impressive advances in technology rely on trained neural nets. The idea is simple: Where traditional programming is all about writing code to solve problems, Machine Learning is about feeding enough data to a neural net to have the machine figure out the complicated stuff on its own.

Companies such as Google, Tesla or Cruise are using Machine Learning to build self-driving cars. Apps such as PRISMA use it to turn regular photos into amazing art inspired by real artists.

Many people believe that Machine Learning and artificial intelligence will have a similar impact on our daily life as the invention of the internet.

But there's a problem though...

## Sience is hard

Despite still being a very academical field, building your own neural network has already become much easier with the success of frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras or Theanos.

But even with these great frameworks available itâ€™s still unnecessary hard for traditional developers, or web developers (like us) to dive into this amazing field of sofware technology.

Using Machine Learning to solve problems requires a certain infrastructure and computational power to get things going. Coming from a field such as web development the barrier of entry can seem very high.

- Setting up the environment is tedious
- Consumer hardware lacks resources needed for proper training
- Time consuming training can't block local hardware for hours/days
- Experiments can't be easily shared, demoed and forked by others

## Meet MachineLabs

We think Machine Learning should be simple and fun. We believe, that if we manage to help people getting started easier and faster with Machine Learning, everyone will benefit

With MachineLabs we are building what could be best described as the CodePen for Machine Learning.

## Run your experiments in the cloud

With MachineLabs there's no need to get distracted with server maintanance. You can solve your first Machine Learning task right from within your browser!

Your training may run for hours or even several days and you'll be able to conveniently come back any time to check its status or watch it learning right in your browser.

We make sure your experiments run on blazingly fast hardware to crack real world problems!

## Sharing is caring

We believe that for the benefit of everyone it is crucial to accelerate knowledge sharing in the Machine Learning field. With MachineLabs, labs can be forked, shared and tuned as simple as CodePens! Imagine having a lab with a steering prediction for a self-driving car right in your browser and have it forkable and hackable for everyone.

Just like people share CodePens on StackOverflow, we want everyone to be able to share or embed labs on other websites to improve the overall aproachability of this exciting technology.

## Will this be a free service?

We do want to improve the situation for a broad audience. Hence, labs and existing executions can always be viewed by everyone (unless intentionally made private). Registered users will also be able to execute code on limited hardware up to the point where a certain monthly limit is reached. To execute code beyond these limitations and on blazingly fast GPU-powered hardware we'll have paid plans.

## Will this be open source?

Yes! Well, while we haven't figured out all details yet we are definitely commited to release big parts of the system as open source once we have settled on a solid first design. And with open souce we really mean it. We'll have the code hosted on GitHub, track and discuss issues in the open and will except pull request from external contributors.
