At MachineLabs our main goal is to make Machine Learning more approachable for all kind of different developers.

This mission comes in two parts: Creating an environment that makes it easy to run Machine Learning experiments, and, making it simple to learn how to do Machine Learning in the first place.

Today we are excited to announce the most practical <a href="https://course.machinelabs.ai" title="Machine Learning Jump Start">Machine Learning online course</a>.

### Machine Learning Jump Start - Online Course

Over the last couple of months we've worked tirelessly to make MachineLabs the best platform to get started with Machine Learning. We are excited to see hundreds of users creating exciting experiments on our platform every day.

That said, there's a huge group of developers telling us that they'd love to get started with Machine Learning if it just wasn't that hard. A lot of people seem to be frustrated with the academic, Math-centered approach to Machine Learning that most courses still take today.

Enter our **Machine Learning Jump Start** online course. This course is unlike any other Machine Learning course that we've found. It's from regular developers for regular developers. 

To give you an idea, here's the project's teaser video!

### What's inside?

This course will take you from zero to hero by making you **solve your first Machine Learning task in just 20 lines of pure Python code**. After that the course dives into various topics such as:

- Machine Learning Basics
- Activation functions, Max Pooling and Dropouts
- Common Keras APIs to solve your ML tasks
- Convolutional Networks
- Recurrent Networks
- Reinforcement learning

... and much more!
