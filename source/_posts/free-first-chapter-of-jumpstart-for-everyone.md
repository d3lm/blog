It's been some month since we've [last shared an update](/2017/12/15/machine-learning-jump-start-online-course/) about our upcoming [Machine Learning Jump Start](https://course.machinelabs.ai)

Today we are excited to ???

<!-- more -->

We've finished all videos of the first chapter and are in the final stages of tuning the content to be released very soon.

The first chapter contains:

- bla bla bla
- blub blub blub
- yay yay yay


Our actual plan was to release the Early Access Preview (EAP) to everyone who pre-ordered the course and collect the fees. However, we decided to publish the entire first chapter as a free gift for the general public!

That doesn't change anything for everyone who pre-ordered the course already.

**Please remember that no one has been or will be charged a single dollar before the EAP is out.**

We still plan to release an EAP later (targeted for Q1 2019) that will then be exclusively delivered to those who booked the course. 

Pre-ordering the course now is still the best option to guarantee to get the course at a discounted rate.

That, plus the fact that we give a **100 % money back guarantee** for everyone who doesn't like the course, makes the pre-order a steal deal. It basically means everyone can pre-order the course now at a reduced rate, doesn't pay anything before the EAP ships and has the safety net of not paying anything if the course doesn't match the expectations.
